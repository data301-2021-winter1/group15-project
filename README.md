## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset consists of weather data recorded from the surface of Mars by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station onboard the Curiosity Rover. It was gathered from August 7th, 2012 to February 27, 2018 and contains measurements of surface temperature, pressure, and atmospheric opacity corresponding to terrestrial date, sol (days elapsed since landing), solar longitude, Martian month, and transmission identification number. There was also supposed to be wind speed data, however it was largely unavailable.
 
The data was made available by NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory and the Centro de Astrobiología (CSIC-INTA), and we accessed it through The Pudding’s [public repository](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/blob/master/mars-weather/mars-weather.csv). (It was used in their essay [Greetings from Mars](https://pudding.cool/2018/01/mars-weather/)). We assume the data was made public with the intent of fostering scientific research as well as for transparency. When scientists collaborate, the whole world can benefit from their discoveries. The availability of this data also allows students (like us) to learn and experiment.


## Team Members

- Sam Kole: I'm a physics major and want to learn more about practical data analysis (so I can maybe get a job...).
- Remy Adams: I really like travelling and want to go lots of places (like maybe Mars??).
- Malcolm MacLeod: I like the outdoors - I love swimming and going on long walks on the beach.
