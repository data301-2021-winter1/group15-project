## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 word
We are hoping that with this analytics project we will be able to have answers to the following questions: have seasonal temperature changes been observed over the years? Which years had the highest/lowest temperatures? Will the temperature variations provide the necessary requirements to sustain life? Do pressure changes vary seasonally? Does Mars have seasons? And if so, what seasonal variations exist? As a group we chose data on Mars because we shared an interest in space as a whole but wanted to work with a specific planet.  Mars has been the topic of a lot of research, and therefore has provided a lot of data, which made it the best candidate for us to gain knowledge about a planet that is different from our own. We can definitely see ourselves building a dashboard with this data. We have plenty of data to choose from, analyze, and then interpret. We envision graphs and tables conveying the changes in pressure, temperature and seasons. Our data and the questions we intend to answer are quite interesting and as a result will make great content for our dashboard!
