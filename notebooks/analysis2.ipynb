    "My research question is do pressure changes vary seasonally? and what seasonal patterns will you find on Mars? I chose these questions because with my group we talked a lot about the potential for life to be sustained on Mars and a big factor in that would be temperature. Knowing that Earth has a fairly predictable seasonal pattern, I thought it would be interesting to see what patterns exist on Mars and if we could pinpoint a winter, spring, summer and fall. "
